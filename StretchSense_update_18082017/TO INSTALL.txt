This file will guide you to the installation of the StretchSense application. Most of it will be done automatically.

Note: if you don't want to run the script to make the automatic install you can still open the make.sh file with a text editor and run every command step by step manually.

To do it automatically you need to follow the next few steps :

## First step is the installation of the libraries :

1. Open a terminal and go to the location of the StretchSense folder : 

	$ cd yourPath/
	
2. Copy the StretchSense folder to your Desktop :
	
	$ cp -r StretchSense /home/pi/Desktop/

3. Run the following commands to install all the requiries :  

	$ cd /home/pi/Desktop/StretchSense/
	$ sudo chmod 0777 make.sh
	$ yes | ./make.sh


## The second step is enabling the spidev0.0 and spidev0.1 to use the SPI communication.

4. Run the following commands :

	$sudo nano /etc/modprobe.d/raspi-blacklist.conf
		Which should open up a window of code. Find the line of code 'blacklist spi-bcm2708'.
		Make sure that this line doesn't exist or is commented  by adding a hash e.g. '#blacklist spi-bcm2708'
		Save the file:
			CTRL+O
			ENTER
			CTRL+X
	
	$sudo nano /boot/config.txt
	
		If not already written, add this line at the end of the file or just uncomment it 'dtparam=spi=on'
		Save the file:
			CTRL+O
			ENTER
			CTRL+X


# Last step, reboot your Raspberry Pi.
