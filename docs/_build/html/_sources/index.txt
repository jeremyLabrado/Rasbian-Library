Welcome to StretchSense's Raspberry Pi documentation!
=====================================================


.. note:: 

	This the documentation of the three python file representing the Raspberry Pi's documentation API, GUI and two terminal examples.

	- 'StretchSenseLibrary.py' contains the StretchSense API with all the functions that you can use to connect and play with the StretchSense Devices.


	- 'StrechSenseMain.py' contains the code of the GUI, you can use the GUI to connect and see the StretchSense devices responses on the interface. The code is available for you to understand the code. If you want to add other features, it can be done but you need to script this yourself. We don't recommand you to change the functional script if you are not proficient at the language.


	- 'Main.py' contains two short examples of how to use the sensors with different communication types, the first with SPI connection and the other one using BLE connection. It should be used in a terminal.
